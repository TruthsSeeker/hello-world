# hello-world
Hi everyone,
I've come to GitHub because I want to learn to code in order to be able to make my ideas into reality and using GitHub is absolutely necessary in that process.
I'm a former law student who got bored and disgusted with his studies and the format of university.
I'm trying to branch out and become more adaptable to a fast-changing society.
I'm really interested in blockchain technologies as well as machine learning. I think those two technologies are the one most likely to impact the world in a dramatic fashion in the coming years and I want to be ready for them.
